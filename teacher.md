Module Identification & System Breakdown

Students will analyze their assigned project and break it down into functional modules,
sub-modules, user roles, and data requirements. This exercise helps build a strong
foundation for system design and prepares the team for detailed requirement gathering and
architecture planning.
Instructions for Students
1. Identify Core Functional Modules
Break the system into 6–8 major modules.
Examples of generic modules include:
• User Management
• Dashboard
• Product/Service Management
• Order/Booking/Appointment Module
• Reporting & Analytics
• Notifications
• Payments
2. Identify Sub-Modules for Each Module
For every module, list 4–6 sub-features.
Example:
Order Module:
• Create order
• Track order
• Payment processing
• Order history
3. Identify User Roles
List the role types the system will support.
Examples include:

• Admin
• Customer/User
• Vendor/Supplier
• Staff/Manager
4. List Key Entities / Database Tables
Define the primary entities that will be part of your system.
Examples include:
• Users
• Orders
• Products
• Categories
• Payments
• Reviews
5. Draw a Simple High-Level Architecture Diagram
Students may draw anyone:
• Block diagram
• Component diagram
• Simple boxes-and-arrows diagram
(Just show modules and how they interact.)
6. Describe the System Workflow (6–10 Lines)
Write a short description that clearly explains how the overall system works.
